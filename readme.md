## Laravel 5.1 Ecommerce application with Elasticsearch integration

This is a repository for a starting-pack application. I am working on it in my free time. The aim is to become fully functional e-commerce application with many features.

## Aims

As my experience of over 3 years in developing and maintaining eCommerce websites, as well as being inside a company that primarily sells online, I have came to the conclusion that the search engine in a website is as important as it's SEO. And for that - Elasticsearch is there to offer the best experience, flexability and speed.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/dmitov/laravel-ecommerce.git
```
```
composer install --prefer-dist
```
